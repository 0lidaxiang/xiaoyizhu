        <!-- 约会、纪念日记录 -->
        <span class="keyword ">  2018—09-14 ~ 2018—09-16 </span> <span class="lineHeight">We only met each other for a week, so we missed each other so much. I have been used to staying together for two days every week, chatting and playing. This time, after a week, I felt that I had been separated for a year.<br>
        On the evening of Friday, XiaoYi rushed up, hugged me and kiss me. But she already asleep without being crazy for too long. She was too tired. So cute. The next day we went to the movies. It seemed that she didn't concentrate on any movies. I think it would be a problem to choose a movie that she can concentrate on.<br>
        In the evening, Xiaoyi's parents came, let's go to see the float parade, eat noodles and dumplings. In the middle of the night, Because Xiaoyi’s mother forgot to bring proof of identity, we went to the hotel to go to the police station and went to the police station to do the identification after watching the parade. In the end, we didn't do it successfully, so we went to the hotel pretending that we all have the proof of identity. Xiao Yi and her parents talked for more than half an hour, the parents have no longer opposed, and also acquiesced us to sleep together. Good news.<br>
        On Sunday we went to the Bund and the Oriental Pearl. At the top of the Oriental Pearl Tower, Xiaoyi was afraid of seeing the ground from high floor, and did not dare to stay in the glass corridor. With my encouragement and companionship, Xiaoyi still stood up bravely. Xiaoyi is great.
        </span><br/>

        <span class="keyword ">  2018—09-01 ~ 2018—09-02 </span> <span class="lineHeight"> On Saturday morning, Xiaoyi still has to get up early to go to the hospital to study the morning shift. After meeting at noon, sleep directly to the evening. <br>
        At dinner, Xiaoyi, this greedy pig chose to eat grilled fish, but the result was eaten.So she had to stand at the wall in the evening for two hours, it looks like being punished, and the pitiful look is so cute.<br>
        The next day, we first and she first eat the Old-Uncle fast-food. After the heavy rain, we went to Sweet Love Road and Lu Xun Memorial Hall, and ate chicken chops and milk-tea that I thought for a long time.
        </span><br/>

        <span class="keyword ">  2018—08-24 ~ 2018—08-26 </span> <span class="lineHeight"> This weekend is a weekend of study and there is no time to go out to play. Originally, we planned not to meet this weekend. As a result, her ID card was forgotten by me, and she was going to buy her ticket with her ID card on Friday, so we still rushed to meet once on Friday night. I sent her to Jiading North Station.<br>
        By August 26, we have been meeting for two months. The relationship goes further.<br>
        On Friday, Xiaoyi’s mother asked her to go home at night. She had to return to Shanghai on Saturday.
        I accompanied her to the Agricultural Bank Card on Sunday, registered the admission information on my computer, and watched her study.<br>
        Calm days are also full of happiness. I will be happy with you.
